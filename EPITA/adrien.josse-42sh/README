Welcome to the new shell that is 420sh, our own attempt at the 42sh project.

To compile and launch the project, without having too mach trash files at
the source, you can to create a build directory at the and then use cmake.
Proceed as follow:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./42sh

After the compilation process, you can launch the test suite.
It consists of a series of unit tests using Criterion.
As well as a full end-to-end test suite using python.

However, for this test suite to work, you need to activate a virtual
environment within the project.
Follow these steps:

    cd tests/python
    python -m venv env/
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, you can launch the test suite inside the directory
you build the project in, using:

    make check

In case you only want the python test suite, you can use:

    python tests/python/test_suite.py PATH_TO_BINARY

In 420sh, there is an option to print the ast built by the parser and used
by the exec. You can activate the following option:

    ./42sh --ast-print

To compile the resulting .dot file as an image, use:

    dot -Tpng 420sh.dot -o IMAGE_NAME.png

You can then open the image with your viewer of choice.
